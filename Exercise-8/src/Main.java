        SOAP vs REST:

        - SOAP stands for Simple Object Access Protocol whereas REST stands for Representational State Transfer.
        - SOAP is a protocol whereas REST is an architectural pattern.
        - SOAP uses service interfaces to expose its functionality to client applications while REST uses Uniform
          Service locators to access to the components on the hardware device.
        - SOAP needs more bandwidth for its usage whereas REST doesn't need much bandwidth.
        - Comparing SOAP vs REST API, SOAP only works with XML formats whereas REST work with plain text, XML,
          HTML and JSON.
        - SOAP cannot make use of REST whereas REST can make use of SOAP.
        - REST uses easy to understand standards like swagger and OpenAPI Specification 3.0 and requires use of HTTP.
        - SOAP has built-in error handling.
        - SOAP provides significant pre-build extensibility in the form of the WS* standards

        HTTP request methods:

        - GET: The GET method requests a representation (data) of the specified resource. Requests using GET should
          only retrieve data.
        - POST: The POST method submits an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change (create/update)
          in state or side effects on the server.
        - PUT: The PUT method replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.
        - DELETE: The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.
